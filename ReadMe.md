So Twenty-One
=============

An abandoned game by Eli Brody
------------------------------

The game is based on Sleepy Town Manufacture's *So Twenty One*. Used by permission.

You'll need [Allegro](http://alleg.sourceforge.net/) and Visual Studio to compile it. It probably won't work anyway. You may have to go back a few commits to find a stable version. (I believe I was in the middle of porting collisions to Box2D when I stopped working on the project.)
